# Electric Vehicle Growth and Adoption Dashboard (Tableau)

Welcome to the **Electric Vehicle Growth and Adoption Dashboard** created in **Tableau**! This dashboard analyzes the growth and adoption trends of Electric Vehicles (EVs) over the years and provides valuable insights into the EV market, consumer behavior, and the distribution of EVs across different states in the USA.

## Objectives

- **Growth and Adoption Trends**: Visualize the growth in Electric Vehicle adoption over time, focusing on trends like market share and sales growth.
- **Popular EV Brands and Models**: Display the most popular EV brands and models along with their market share to understand consumer preferences.
- **State-wise Distribution**: Show how EV adoption varies across different states, identifying regions with high adoption rates.
- **BEV vs. PHEV Comparison**: Compare the usage patterns between Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), highlighting key differences.
- **Promote Clean Transportation**: Raise awareness about the environmental and economic benefits of clean transportation through data-driven insights.

## Features

- **Interactive Visuals**: Use dynamic filters, charts, and graphs to explore EV adoption trends by region, brand, model, and more.
- **Market Share Analysis**: Display the market share of different EV brands and models with interactive pie charts and bar graphs.
- **State Distribution Map**: View a geographical map of the USA showing state-wise EV adoption with color-coded intensities.
- **BEV vs. PHEV Analysis**: Side-by-side visual comparison of BEVs and PHEVs in terms of adoption rates, performance, and usage.
- **Data Insights**: Drill down into specific data points to uncover detailed insights about the EV industry.
